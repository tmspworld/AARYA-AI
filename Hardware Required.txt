Here is a list of the hardware required to build the AARYA Voice-Controlled AI Assistant module on a Raspberry Pi:

---

 1. Raspberry Pi (Any Model with Audio Support)
- Model: Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 3, or Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Purpose: The main processor to run the AARYA voice module and handle the software processing.
- Note: Raspberry Pi 4 is recommended for better performance due to its processing power and RAM.

---

 2. MicroSD Card (32 GB or Higher)
- Model: Class 10 or UHS-1 microSD card with at least 32 GB storage.
- Purpose: To store the Raspberry Pi OS and the software required for the AARYA module.
- Note: Preload the Raspberry Pi OS using tools like Raspberry Pi Imager.

---

 3. USB Microphone
- Model: Any compatible USB microphone (e.g., Samson Go Mic, Fifine USB Microphone)
- Purpose: To capture voice input for the AARYA assistant to process voice commands.
- Note: Ensure it's compatible with Raspberry Pi. Alternatively, you can use a USB sound card with a 3.5mm microphone input if needed.

---

 4. Speaker or Audio Output Device
- Model: USB speakers or a 3.5mm audio jack speaker.
- Purpose: To output the text-to-speech (TTS) responses from the AARYA assistant.
- Note: You can also use Bluetooth speakers, but ensure Raspberry Pi Bluetooth is configured for output.

---

 5. Power Supply
- Model: Official Raspberry Pi Power Supply (5V, 3A USB-C for Raspberry Pi 4)
- Purpose: To power the Raspberry Pi and all peripherals.
- Note: Ensure the power supply is reliable, especially if additional peripherals like USB hubs are used.

---

 6. USB Hub (Optional)
- Model: Powered USB Hub (e.g., Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub)
- Purpose: If you're using multiple USB devices (like a microphone, speaker, etc.), a USB hub may be necessary to manage connections.

---

 7. Ethernet Cable or Wi-Fi Dongle
- Model: Raspberry Pi 4 comes with built-in Wi-Fi, but earlier models may require a USB Wi-Fi dongle (e.g., TP-Link Nano).
- Purpose: To connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet for ChatGPT API requests and updates.
- Note: If not using Wi-Fi, use an Ethernet cable to connect to your router.

---

 8. Case (Optional)
- Model: Any Raspberry Pi-compatible case (e.g., the official Raspberry Pi case).
- Purpose: To protect the Raspberry Pi from dust and potential damage, and for better cable management.
- Note: Cases with built-in fans can help with heat dissipation if running the system for long periods.

---

 9. Heat Sinks or Cooling Fan (Optional)
- Model: Small heat sinks or a cooling fan for Raspberry Pi.
- Purpose: To prevent overheating, especially if using Raspberry Pi 4 for prolonged periods.
- Note: Not mandatory but recommended for optimal performance and longevity.

---

 10. HDMI Cable and Monitor (for Initial Setup)
- Model: Standard HDMI to micro HDMI cable for Raspberry Pi 4 or HDMI cable for Raspberry Pi 3.
- Purpose: Used during the initial setup of the Raspberry Pi OS and software. After setup, the monitor may not be needed for headless operation.
- Note: Alternatively, use VNC or SSH for remote setup and control.

---

 11. Keyboard and Mouse (for Initial Setup)
- Model: Any USB or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.
- Purpose: For initial setup and configuration of the Raspberry Pi.
- Note: Once setup is complete, the Raspberry Pi can be accessed remotely, and these peripherals may no longer be required.

---

 12. USB Sound Card (Optional)
- Model: If the built-in audio and USB microphone donâ€™t work together, use a USB sound card (e.g., UGREEN USB sound card adapter).
- Purpose: Allows connecting both microphone and speakers through a single USB port.
- Note: Useful for systems without separate audio and mic inputs.
